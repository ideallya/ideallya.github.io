Temporary redirect from old news articles

World news, compiled from public broadcasters across the world, and mostly anonymised to reduce bias.

In combination, it presents a fairly balanced news feed.

The redirect pages are generated in this repo, and used to show cards on Twitter. https://twitter.com/IdeallyaNews

The news feed is also available at https://ideallya.com/news
